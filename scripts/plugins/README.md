Plugins
-------

Plugins needs casperjs. First, install python 2.7 and add `C:\Python27` to your PATH environment var.
Then, just run :
```bash
npm install -g phantomjs
npm install -g casperjs
```

If you're on windows, you need sh in your path (install git bash for example, and add `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin` to your path).


To run a plugin, just run `run.sh` in the plugin directory (you can enter your credentials in `configuration.cfg`).
